# Weather comparison


We all know that the weather observations are different from one website to another.

Here is a little tool allowing you to compare the observations from different websites.

## Overview

- Get the weather observation data from several weather REST APIs
- Gather the data and show it nicely using d3.js
- Add a bit of AngularJS for the interactivity

2. **npm install** to install all the dependancies listes in **package.json**
3. 
  1. **gulp compile** to compile the development build
  2. **gulp compile_production** to compile the production build
